> - Enhancing Property Development with the Power of Blockchain: The Property Development Contract
>
#### How it works? 
> - Imagine you're involved in a property development project, and you want to ensure transparency and efficient management of funds throughout the process. The "Property Development Contract" is a smart contract designed specifically for this purpose, operating on the blockchain.

> - Input: The contract requires two crucial inputs:

> - Stages of property development: These stages encompass activities such as planning, construction, and the eventual sale of the developed property. Each stage is defined and recorded within the contract, providing a clear roadmap for the project.

> - Completion status of each stage: The contract keeps track of the progress made in each stage. It relies on the provided information to verify the successful completion of each stage.

> - Fund Release: The primary objective of the contract is to facilitate the release of funds at different stages of the property development process.

> - As the contract holds the allocated funds for property development, it ensures that the funds are only released when the corresponding stage is marked as completed.
> - For instance, once the planning stage is successfully completed and verified, the contract automatically triggers the release of the designated funds for that stage.
> - The same process applies to subsequent stages like construction and sale, with funds being released upon completion and verification.
> - By implementing the "Property Development Contract" on the blockchain, you benefit from the following advantages:

> - Transparency: The contract records and tracks the progress of each stage on the blockchain. This creates a transparent and auditable record of the development process, allowing stakeholders to monitor and verify the project's status.

> - Efficiency: The contract automates the fund release process. It eliminates the need for manual intervention and streamlines the overall management of funds, reducing administrative overhead and potential delays.

> - Security: The contract securely holds the allocated funds within its framework. This ensures that the funds are safeguarded until the successful completion of each stage, mitigating the risk of misappropriation or misuse.

> - Accountability: The immutable nature of the blockchain ensures that the recorded stages and fund releases cannot be tampered with. This promotes accountability among all parties involved in the property development project.

#### Code Blocks and explanations:

- Deposit 1 - Land Acquisition: The contract starts with a deposit made by the "Land2023-0" role to a designated address. This deposit signifies the acquisition of a land asset related to the property development project. It involves the transfer of a token called "Land2023-1" and a constant value of 1, indicating the initial step towards property development.

- Deposit 2 - Progressing the Development: Once the first deposit is successfully completed, it triggers another deposit by the same "Land2023-0" role to the same address. This second deposit marks progress in the property development project. It involves the transfer of a different token called "Land2023-2" and a constant value of 1, signifying advancement to the next stage of development.

- Deposit 3 - Advancing Further: After the second deposit, the contract proceeds to the next stage of development. It initiates a third deposit made by the "Land2023-0" role to the same address. This deposit signifies further progress in the property development project. It involves the transfer of the "Land2023-3" token and a constant value of 1, indicating the completion of a critical milestone.

- Completion and Fund Transfer: Upon the successful completion of the third deposit, the contract reaches a specific condition. It triggers a deposit from a specified address to the "Land2023-0" role. This deposit signifies the release of funds to support the property development project.

- Contract Termination: Finally, the code concludes with a Close statement, indicating the termination of the contract execution. This signifies the completion of the defined actions and conditions within the contract.

- The role token represents the other three NFTs. The contract will hold the three NFTs until the year 2030, unless 500 Ada is paid by the role to remove the three NFTs, breaking up the collection.
