EstateLedger is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize the real estate industry. Building on the Cardano blockchain, EstateLedger will leverage the power of smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized finance to create a more transparent, efficient, and accessible real estate market.
At the core of EstateLedger is a suite of smart contracts that manage various aspects of the real estate transaction process. These contracts handle everything from land acquisition and property development to token trading and profit distribution. By automating these processes with smart contracts, EstateLedger eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and speeds up the transaction process.


Base Contracts:

1. [Land Acquisition Contract](/Base-Contracts/LandAquisitionContract/LandAquisitionContract.md): Handles the acquisition of land from landlords.
2. [Token Contract](/Base-Contracts/TokenContract/TokenContract.md): Manages the creation and distribution of tokens representing stakes in the property development.
3. [Property Development Contract](/Base-Contracts/PropertyDevelopementContract/PropertyDevelopementContract.md): Manages the stages of property development, releasing funds for each stage upon completion.
4. [Trading Contract](/Base-Contracts/TradingContract/TradingContract.md): Facilitates the trading of tokens on the marketplace.
5. [Profit Distribution Contract](/Base-Contracts/ProfitDistributionContract/ProfitDistributionContract.md): Manages the distribution of profits from property sales to the token holders.
6. [Governance Contract](/Base-Contracts/GovernanceContract/GovernanceContract.md): Handles the governance of the platform, allowing token holders to submit proposals and vote on changes to the platform.

Derivative Contracts:

1. [Derivative Contracts]: Provide additional financial instruments based on the future price of properties or tokens, allowing users to speculate on price movements and manage their risk.


EstateLedger also introduces a novel approach to real estate investment through tokenization. Each property on the platform is represented by a unique token, and these tokens can be bought and sold on the EstateLedger marketplace. This opens up the real estate market to a wider range of investors and provides more liquidity.
In addition to these base features, EstateLedger will incorporate several advanced technologies to enhance its functionality and user experience. IoT devices will be used to monitor and manage properties in real time, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms analyze data and automate processes, and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality technologies enhance the property viewing experience.

One of the most innovative features of EstateLedger is its integration of derivative contracts. These contracts provide additional financial instruments based on the future price of properties or tokens, allowing users to speculate on price movements and manage their risk. This adds another layer of financial innovation to the platform and provides more opportunities for users.
